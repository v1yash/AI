## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/v1yash/AI.git
    cd AI
    ```

2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 📝 Usage

- Explore the `notebooks/` directory for Jupyter notebook demos.
- Run scripts in the `ai/` folder for specific tasks.
- To play the Tic-Tac-Toe game with AI:
    ```bash
    python ox.py
    ```
- Modify or extend the code for your own experiments.

## 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI (ox.py)

This project includes a graphical Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against an unbeatable AI powered by the Minimax algorithm.

**How to play:**
- Run `python ox.py`
- Click on the grid to make your move as "X".
- The AI ("O") will respond after your turn.
- Win, lose, or draw messages are displayed after each game.

**Features:**
- Tkinter-based GUI
- AI uses Minimax for optimal play
- Immediate feedback and automatic board reset
